	\par This assignment will address the presence of vulnerabilities in software projects. For this task, we developed a simple Web Application for a Health Clinic, exposed its security flaws and weaknesses and in the end present the impact of each flaw and solutions.
	\par
To categorize and evaluate each security flaw we used \href{https://cwe.mitre.org/}{Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)} and \href{https://cve.mitre.org/}{Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)}
